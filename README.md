# Tree automata essentials in Python

This repository contains two python packages:

- A python library providing the essentials for building and handling tree-automata, under the `python` repository.
- A plugin (installable as a separated python package) providing a faster alternative to the core data-structures and operations used by the above python tree automata library, available as a C extension. It is located under the `c_backend` repository.

## Installation:
You can install both package separately (see the corresponding README in each sub-repository). To install everything, use the `install.sh` script provided. Activate first the python virtual environment in which you desire the python packages to be installed.
